## Functional Programming 

## Why

## Goals
-  Understand functional programing principles
-  Functions as first class Objects
-  Functions as objects 
    - Assigning functions to variables 
    - Pass functions as arguments to other functions
    - Return functions inside of functions
    - functions on functions inside of functions 

-  Pure functions 
   - Return a value
   - Have no side effects
   - given the same input will have the same output

- Avoiding Shared State
- Mutable Data
    -   - Object.freeze
- Side Effects
